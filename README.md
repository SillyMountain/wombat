# wombat

The wombat library will provide many classes to replace/extend the C++ Standard Library. Right now the following sections are planned:

 * Data Structures
 * Loging
 * Threading
 * Filesystem
 * Networking
 * String Utilities
 * Data File Formats (JSON/XML/...)
 * many more
 
## Goals

The main reason this library exists is that C++ starts to look ugly very quickly, espacially when using the STL or Boost (Please note, this is just personal feeling, Both libraries are realy great I just do not enjoy using them). Furthermore I would like to have Java-Like features in a native language. So in short:

 * Good Readability
 * Good Performance
 * Good Deabuging
